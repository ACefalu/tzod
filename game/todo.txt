set object position from Lua?

Q22) Why do I get an error when trying to open a new socket soon after I've closed a socket on the same port?
This happens in TCP, because the implementation will wait for a while to allow any late, missed fragments to arrive (even though nobody will read them). This is to avoid confusing fragments from a previous connection with fragments from a new connection.

To turn off this behavior, turn on the SO_REUSEADDR socket option as soon as you've created the socket; this will allow future sockets to re-bind to the same port without waiting for the timeout to expire.

portable object id:
 - since world is sumulated simultaniously on all clients we could use allocation ID to identify object on other client
 - allocation ID is kind of persistent pointer that can be serialized or passed via network
 - allocation id is composed of two parts: block index and offset within block so no extra memory cost
 - in our memory model an allocation unit has pointer to parent block. use this info to calculate an object id
 - security. one can pass bad id to chash client so we need validation mechanism
